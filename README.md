### Hi there 👋

I'm currently working on hush-hush 🤫 projects which I can't talk about.  

But what I can talk about is that I've been trying to help out on projects (like CCHits), and done a couple of hacktober fests.
I pretty much ❤️ getting the nuts and bolts of a project working - so I'm happy setting up unit tests, continuous integration and deployment.

Here's what I'd like to work on (when I get chance).

* Guest Room
  * I've got a small fleet of Google Chromecast things, and I would like to set up a Guest room tv (like a hotel) with information about what is available on the home network.
* My own Fanfare
  * I like the wrestling - I'm not a ultra fan, but if I'm watching TV and there's wrestling on... I'll watch it.  So what I'd like to do is have My PC play my own wrestler music when I get home - probably when my bluetooth phone comes into range.I might even crack out an arduino to make that work.
* I'd like to make a Festival voice of my voice - because primarily I'm interested in how the process works.  
  * After that I'd like to set up some projects around regional dialects.  I'm from a region in the West Midlands known as the [Black Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country) and they have their own sort of dialect - and other areas of the country have their own dialects or languages.  I'm not a linguist, and I know nothing of it, but it would be interested to research about.
